# Hubitat Elevate Haiku Driver
A Hubitat Elevate driver for Haiku fans

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

Working:
* Note that the device page takes 3 seconds to load. This is intentional to allow for all of your devices to respond in time. It probably doesn't need to be this long and you can adjust it as needed (will probably be a config in the future)
* After adding a device using this driver, select your fan under Preferences and save
* Set speed and level don't work
* On and Off work
